🚀 **Excited to share my latest project!** 🎉

I’ve created an interactive Power BI dashboard using a comprehensive dataset that includes vital information such as:



- 🆔 **Row ID**: Unique identifiers for each entry
- 📦 **Order ID**: Track individual orders
- 📅 **Order Date & Ship Date**: Monitor order timelines
- 🚚 **Ship Mode**: Analyze delivery methods
- 👤 **Customer ID & Name**: Understand customer demographics
- 🏙️ **Location**: Country, City, State, Region
- 🛍️ **Product Details**: ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
- 📊 **Sales Metrics**: Sales, Quantity, Profit, Returns
- 💳 **Payment Mode**: Review transaction methods

The dashboard offers valuable insights into sales performance and customer behavior, helping to drive data-driven decisions! 📈✨
